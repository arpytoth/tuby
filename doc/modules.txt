Tuby Modules are pieces of C code that extends the Tuby Language. For 
example the string type is implemented using the string module. Anyway,
there are some rules on how these modules should be implemented:

1. Each module should be defined in one .h and one .c file named:
   tuby_module_name.h and tuby_module_name.c. For example:
   tuby_string.h and tuby_string.c.


2. Each module should have an initialize function. THis function will
   be called by the runtime, before parsing the source code and it will
   initialize the custom type introduced by the module if any, and
   all the functions.

3. Module functions should be named as follows: 
        module_prefix_function_name();   

   For example:
        string_strlen();
